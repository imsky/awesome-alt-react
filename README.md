**Awesome ways to build frontend projects without React.**

React is ~10 years old. It's a good time to review alternatives.

Since 2016 &bull; [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sveltejs/svelte)](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/stargazers)

> Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) <br>Since 2015 &bull; [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/vuejs/core)](https://github.com/vuejs/core/stargazers)

> Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn’t seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it’s not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it’s designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine.

[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) <br>Since 2019 &bull; [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ionic-team/stencil)](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/stargazers)
